**Describe the bug**
More than likely this is something to do with dependencies, references, and/or what is not included in the samples vs in the package manager as this is in beta. Make sure to [check out the video](https://youtu.be/3nW1QMGXDGk) that goes along with this before you submit the bug just to make sure we aren't dealing with something silly via Unity! 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. I opened Unity and the world is on fire...
2. I then found the package manager to have been wiped away
3. I am one step away from deleting the Library folder and starting over...
4. F*** this I'm going to Unreal!

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
