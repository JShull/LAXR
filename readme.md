# LAXR

First adventure into making some specific Unity tools for XR work. LAXR is the Lazarsfeld apparatus for XR. [Paul Lazarsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lazarsfeld) is credited for being one of the founders of the modern day survey tool. I need some survey tools that work on current XR frameworks and I work in Unity so here we be!

## Active Development Dates

* November 2019
  * Initial framework for themes, pages, layouts, and fonts
  * All tied to structs - not sure if I'm going to pull these out - combine them with scriptable assets - or who knows, get real crazy and go full ECS
* August 2021
  * Well it's been a minute! Sort of forgot about this work I was doing, think it's still usable going to update a few things and see if I can pump out something that makes sense.
* November 2021
  * Lazarsfeld is almost alive!
    * Data tool for procedurally generating a diegetic simple survey apparatus
      * Likert based questions (working)
      * Multiple choice questions (on their way)
      * Multiple select questions (on their way)
      * JSON serialized class tied to a series of scriptable objects and prefabs (partially working)

## Install & Dependencies

* **VERY IMPORTANT**
  * You need to have a fresh Unity project already configured with [MRTK 2.7.2](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)
  * Some minor [MRTK Bug Fixes](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/pull/9938/commits/b199b3459298f31a599c28ab7863d0abb1a5acdf)
    * This should be fun!
* Unity Package Manager to the rescue!

## License Notes

* This software running a dual license
* Most of the work this repository holds is driven by the development process from the team over at Unity3D :heart: to their never ending work on providing fantastic documentation and tutorials that have allowed this to be born into the world.
* I personally feel that software and it's practices should be out in the public domain as often as possible, I also strongly feel that the capitalization of people's free contribution shouldn't be taken advantage of.
  * If you want to use this software to generate a profit for you/business I feel that you should equally 'pay up' and in that theory I support strong copyleft licenses.
  * If you feel that you cannot adhere to the GPLv3 as a business/profit please reach out to me directly as I am willing to listen to your needs and there are other options in how licenses can be drafted for specific use cases, be warned: you probably won't like them :rocket:
